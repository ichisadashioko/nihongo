# [State-of-Being](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/stateofbeing)

In English, the verb "to be" is used to describe what something is or where it is, for example: "He is a student" and "He is at school". In Japanese, the two are described very differently. The state-of-being we will learn is used to describe only what something is and not where it exists.

The state-of-being is very easy to describe because it is implied within the noun or adjective. There is no need to use a verb nor even a subject to make a complete sentence in Japanese. Take for example, a casual conversation among friends asking, "How are you?"

**How are you? (casual)**

A : 元気？

B : 元気。

## Polite State-of-being

While the previous dialogue may be fine among close friends, you should use the polite form when speaking to a teacher, a superior such as your boss, or people you're not very familiar with.

For nouns and adjectives, all that is required for the polite form is to add `です` to the end of the sentence. We did this in our simple self-introduction in the last section and because it's understood by context that you are talking about yourself, there is no need to add a subject.

We can ask question in the polite form by further adding `か` to `です`. The `か` is a question marker so a question mark is not necessary. Below is a simple greeting in the polite form.

**How are you?**

A : 元気ですか。

B : げんきです。

## Practical Applications

Here's an example of a casual morning greeting between two classmates and a polite morning greeting with the teacher.

**Casual Morning Greeting**

アリス : おはよう。

リー : おはよう。

アリス : 元気？

リー : 元気。

**Polite Morning Greeting**

先生 : おはようございます。

スミス : おはようございます！

先生 : お元気ですか。

スミス : 元気です。

You can follow a similar model to practice greeting people in the morning. We'll learn the expressions for afternoon and evening greetings in the next section.
