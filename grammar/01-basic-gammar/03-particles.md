# [Introduction to Particles](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/particlesintro)

## Defining grammatical functions with particles

We want to now make good use of what we learned in the last lesson by associating a noun with another noun. This is done with something called particles. Particles are one or more Hiragana characters that attach to the end of a word to define the grammatical function of that word in the sentence. Using the correct particles is very important because the meaning of a sentence can completely change just by changing the particles. For example, the sentence "Eat fish." can become "The fish eats." simply by changing one particle.

## The `は` topic particle

### Vocabulary

1. うん - yes (casual)
1. ううん - no (casual)
1. <ruby>今日<rt>きょう</rt></ruby> - today
1. <ruby>明日<rt>あした</rt></ruby> - tomorrow
1. <ruby>先<rt>せん</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby> - teacher
1. <ruby>試<rt>し</rt>験<rt>けん</rt></ruby> - exam

The first particle we will learn is the topic particle. The topic particle identifies what it is that you're talking about, essentially the topic of your sentence. Let's say a person says, "Not student." This is a perfectly valid sentence in Japanese but it doesn't tell us much without knowing what the person is talking about. The topic particle is the character `は`. Now, while this character is normally pronouned as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle.

__Example 1__

ボブ

> <ruby>アリスは<rt></rt>学<rt>がく</rt>生<rt>せい</rt>？</ruby>

アリス

> <ruby>うん、<rt></rt>学<rt>がく</rt>生<rt>せい</rt>。</ruby>

Here, Bob is indicating that his question is about Alice. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself.

__Example 2__

ボブ

> <ruby>ジョンは<rt></rt>明日<rt>あした</rt>？</ruby>

アリス

> <ruby>ううん、<rt></rt>明日<rt>あした</rt>じゃない。</ruby>

Since we have no context, we don't have enough information to make any sense of this conversation. It obviously makes no sense for John to actually __be__ tomorrow. Given a context, as long as the sentence has something to do with John and tomorrow, it can mean anything. For instance, they could be talking about when John is taking an exam.

__Example 3__

アリス

> <ruby>今日<rt>きょう</rt>は<rt></rt>試<rt>し</rt>験<rt>けん</rt>だ。</ruby>

ボブ

> ジョンは？

アリス

> <ruby>ジョンは<rt></rt>明日<rt>あした</rt>。</ruby>

The last example shows how generic the topic of a sentence is. A topic can be referring to any action or object from anywhere even including other sentences. For example, in the last sentence from the previous example, even though the sentence is about when the exam is for John, the word "exam" doesn't appear anywhere in the sentence!

We'll see a more specific particle that ties more closely into the sentence at the end of this lesson with the identifier particle.

## The `も` inclusive topic particle

### Vocabulary

1. <ruby>先<rt>せん</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby> - teacher
1. うん - yes (casual)
1. ううん - no (casual)
1. でも - but

Another particle that is very similar to the topic particle is the inclusive topic particle. It is essentially the topic particle with the additional meaning of "also". Basically, it can introduce another topic in additionto the current topic. The inclusive topic particle is the `も` character and its use is best explained by an example.

__Example 1__

ボブ : アリスは学生？

アリス : うん、トムも学生。

The inclusion of `も` must be consistent with the answer. It would not make sense to say, "I am a student, and Tom is also not a student." Instead, use the `は` particle to make a break from the inclusion as seen in the next example.
