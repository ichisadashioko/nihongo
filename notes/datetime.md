Some visual novels order events by day so I need to know how to read those date.

Now I need to know the equipvalent of January to December in 日本語.

After looking up in `jisho.org`, I think I will know how they are read now.

```
January     一月    いちがつ
February    二月    にがつ
March       三月    さんがつ
April       四月    しがつ
May         五月    ごがつ
June        六月    ろくがつ
July        七月    しちがつ
August      八月    はちがつ
September   九月    くがつ
October     十月    じゅうがつ
