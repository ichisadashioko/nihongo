# Expressing state-of-being

## Declaring something is so and so using `だ`

### Vocabulary

1. <ruby>人<rt>ひと</rt></ruby> - person
2. <ruby>学<rt>がく</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby> - student
3. <ruby>元<rt>げん</rt>気<rt>き</rt></ruby> - health; lively

One of the trickiest part of Japanese is that there is no verb for the state-of-being like the verb "to be" in English. You can, however, declare what something is by attaching the Hiragana character `だ` to a noun or na-adjective **only**. (We will learn about na-adjectives in the section on adjectives later.)

**Declaring that something is so using `だ`**

- Attach `だ` to the noun or na-adjective

Example: 人 + だ = 人だ

### Examples

1. 人だ。
2. 学生だ。
3. 元気だ。

Seems easy enough. Here's the real kicker though

**A state-of-being can be implied without using `だ`!

You can say you're doing well or someone is a student without using `だ` at all. For example, below is an example of a very typical greeting among friends. Also notice how the subject isn't even specified when it's obvious from the context.

### Typical casual greeting

A : 元気？

B : 元気。

So you may be wondering, "What's the point of using `だ`?" Well, the main difference is that a declarative statement makes the sentence sound more emphatic and forceful in order to make it more... well declarative. Therefore, it is more common to hear men use `だ` at the end of sentences.

The declarative `だ` is also needed in various grammatical structures when a state-of-being must be explicitly declared. There also times when you cannot attach it. It's all quite a pain in the butt really but you don't have to worry about it yet.

## Conjugating to the negative state-of-being

### Vocabulary

1. <ruby>学<rt>がく</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby> - student
2. <ruby>友<rt>とも</rt>達<rt>だち</rt></ruby> - friend
3. <ruby>元<rt>げん</rt>気<rt>き</rt></ruby> - health; lively

In Japanese, negative and past tense are all expressed by conjugation. We can conjugate a noun or adjective to either its negative or past tense to say that something is *not* `X` or that something *was* `X`. This may be a bit hard to grasp at first but none of these state-of-being conjugations make anything declarative like `だ` does. We'll learn how to make these tenses declarative like `だ` does. We'll learn how to make these tenses declarative by attaching `だ` to the end of the sentence in a later lesson.

First, for the negative, attach `じゃない` to the noun or na-adjective.

**Conjugation rules for the negative state-of-being**

- Attach `じゃない` to the noun or na-adjective

Example: 学生 + じゃない = 学生じゃない

### Examples

1. 学生じゃない。
2. 友達じゃない。
3. 元気じゃない。

## Conjugating to the past state-of-being

### Vocabulary

1. <ruby>学<rt>がく</rt>生<rt>せい</rt></ruby> - student
2. <ruby>友<rt>とも</rt>達<rt>だち</rt></ruby> - friend
3. <ruby>元<rt>げん</rt>気<rt>き</rt></ruby> - health; lively

We will now learn the past tense of the state-of-being. To say something *was* something, attach `だった` to the noun or na-adjective.

In order to say the negative past (*was not*), conjugate the negative to the negative past tense by dropping the `い` from `じゃない` and adding `かった`.

**Conjugation rules for the past state-of-being**

1. **Past state-of-being:** Attach `だった` to the noun or na-adjective

Example: 友達 + だった = 友達だった

2. **Negative past state-of-being:** Conjugate the noun or na-adjective to the negative first and then replace the `い` of `じゃない` with `かった`

Example: 友達じゃない &#8594; 友達じゃなかった

### Example

1. 学生だった。
2. 友達じゃなかった。
3. 元気じゃなかった。

## Conjugation summary

We've learned how to express state-of-being in all four tenses. Next we will learn some particles, which will allow us assign roles to words. Here is a summary chart of the conjugations we learned in this section.
